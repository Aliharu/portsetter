Portsetter Project CS 3370

I used g++ portsetter.cpp -o portsetter.cpp.o to create the file

Then either setport -p 5000 or portsetter.cpp.o -p 5000 to run the program (setport works if you have set the alias)

To add alias to the project go to the .bash_aliases page and add "portsetter.cpp.o"=setport to the bottom of the list
